## Description
<!-- 
  Explain what this is about, try to use full sentences, and make your point clear.
-->
For accessibility the website should have hot keys or shortcuts defined.
As is, the entire website is already usable with only a keyboard, however it'd be more
friendly to have a generic hot key component which can be activiated to show the user
what shortcuts are available to more quickly go through the website.

## Motivation
This is good for accessibility as it reduces the need to use the mouse or for users
that visit the site very frequently and more familiar with it.

  If you can, show us what you'd expect this to look like or be used.
  Alternatively you can put screenshots if where this may have been implemented elsewhere.
