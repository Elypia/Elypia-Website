# Elypia Website [![matrix-members]][matrix] [![discord-members]][discord] [![i18n-badge]][i18n] [![gitlab-build]][gitlab] [![gitlab-coverage]][gitlab] [![donate-shield]][elypia-donate]
## About
This is the frontend for the Elypia website.

# Requirements
* [Elypia API] *
* [Angular 9+]
* [NodeJS 12.15.0]
> \* The frontend should still render well without an available
> backend in order to make development easier, and to give a
> consistent look and feel where it may be down. It's still
> recommended to set up the backend and run it in your development
> environment when convenient to do so.
