## About
This is the frontend for the Elypia website.

# Requirements
* [Elypia API][elypia-api] *
* [NodeJS 10.16.3][node]
* [Angular 8+][angular]
> \* The frontend should still render well without an available backend in order to make
> development easier, and to give a consistent look and feel where it may be down.
> It's still recommended to set up the backend and run it in your 
> development environment when convenient to do so.
