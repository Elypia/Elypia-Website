        <h2 i18n>Introduction</h2>
        <p i18n>
          Elypia CIC is a non-profit
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_interest_company" target="_blank">Community Interest Company</a>
          based in the United Kingdom that wants to bring more free and open-source software to
          different sectors. This is starting with software development, aimed at junior developers,
          and will hopefully move towards other areas outside of software that may aid educational institutions or
          less developed sectors attain alternatives over abandoned legacy applications.

        <h2 i18n>Legal</h2>
        <p i18n>
          A Community Interest Company is a non-profit organization in the United Kingdom which
          has the structure of a limited company, but pledges to use its surplus for community benefit,
          as opposed to the benefit of its directors. As a CIC, Elypia has a responsibility to follow
          its Articles of Association and Community Interest Statement which can both be found on the
          <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/12203025" target="_blank">Companies House</a>
          website. All projects Elypia takes on will adhere to the objectives in the aforementioned documents.

        <h2 i18n>Mission</h2>
        <p i18n>
          Elypia wants to aid the future of software and technology by providing FOSS
          (free and open-source software) to the public free of charge. We want to see more libraries and frameworks that allow
          junior developers to create enterprise grade applications for small-scale purposes,
          ready to take that knowledge with them to support other projects and businesses.
          We also want to help create modern, secure, and reliable software, that can be referenced
          or derived from for small businesses without worrying about legacy applications that are no longer
          supported with no viable or affordable alternative.
