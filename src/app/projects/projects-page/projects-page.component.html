        Commandler is a generic command handling framework for Java that
        allows you to write your code once and integrate it anywhere
        or multiple places in a single application.
      </p>
      <p i18n>
        Commandler will handle all the work so it keeps implementing
        commands quick and simple while the bulk of the work is handled by the framework.

        Elypiai is a small but useful library that provides wraps for
        many APIs available online that don't already have official implementations.
      </p>
      <p i18n>
        All wraps have been abstracted as to make it more consistent between
        web services you're implementing and maximize pooling resources.
