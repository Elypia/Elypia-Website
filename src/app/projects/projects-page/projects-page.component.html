        Commandler is a generic command handling framework for Java that
        allows you to write your code once and integrate it anywhere
        or multiple places in a single application.
      </p>
      <p i18n>
        Commandler makes implementing commands quick and simple without the boilerplate,
        while the bulk of the work is handled by the framework.

        This is great for applications where you want to have a UI
        for users to tailor their experience without having to write your
        own web service dedicated to the generic job we all need.

        Elypiai is a small but useful library that provides wraps for
        many APIs available online that don't already have official implementations.
      </p>
      <p i18n>
        All wraps have been abstracted as to make it more consistent between
        web services you're implementing and maximize pooling resources.
