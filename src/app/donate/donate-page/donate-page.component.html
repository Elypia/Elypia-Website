      <h2 i18n>Elypia is a Non-Profit CIC</h2>
      <p i18n>
        While we try to be sustainable through subscriptions and services, it's favorable to receive
        donations to keep everything as free as possible. As a non-profit, funding is what allows us to
        continue to develop free and open-source software and push to provide free or affordable services.
      </p>
      <p i18n>
        As a Community Interest Company we will also be able to generate income
        through selling subscriptions and services or by providing hosted solutions
        for our open-source projects.
        Donations will not be the only form of income for Elypia but strongly encouraged
        and appreciated.
      </p>

      <h2 i18n>Where do donations go?</h2>
      <p i18n>
        At present most costs are for technical infrastructure or legal obligations to keep
        Elypia CIC and its websites and services up. This includes domains, hosting,
        content delivery, travel or paperwork, and any annual fees or requirements in order
        to fulfill company wide obligations under legal justification.
        Some projects may incur costs if new assets or branding is desired for them.
        We are hopeful that in the future Elypia will be able to provide salaries
        to those contributing and managing Elypia's projects.
