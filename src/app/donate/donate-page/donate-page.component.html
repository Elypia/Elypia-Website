    <p i18n="@@donate-elypia-is-cic-body-1">
      While we try to be sustainable through subscriptions and services, it's favorable to receive
      donations to keep everything as free as possible. As a non-profit, funding is what allows us to
      continue to develop free and open-source software and push to provide free or affordable services.
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@elypia-is-cic-body-2">
      As a Community Interest Company we will also be able to generate income
      through selling subscriptions and services or by providing hosted solutions
      for our open-source projects.
      Donations will not be the only form of income for Elypia but strongly encouraged
      and appreciated.
    </p>

    <p i18n="@@donate-where-do-they-go-body">
      At present most costs are for technical infrastructure or legal obligations to keep
      Elypia CIC and it's websites and services up. This includes domains, hosting,
      content delivery, travel or paperwork, and any annual fees or requirements in order
      to fulfill company wide obligations under legal justification.
      Some projects may incur costs if new assets or branding is desired for them.
      We are hopeful that in the future Elypia will be able to provide salaries
      to those contributing and managing Elypia's projects.
